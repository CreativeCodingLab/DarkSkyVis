## Progress
### Round1
The first image is proof of concept image of flowlines generated from particle velocities extracted from the `ds14_scivis_0128_e4_dt04_1.0000` dataset. Data was converted to VTK XML format and visualized using Paraview

### Round2
Following the initial proof of concepts and playing with the functionality of YT and Paraview, I eneded up settling (almost by accident) on VTK. In particular, I decided that while Volume Rendering and Volume Compositiing are neat, that is not the direction I want to go with this visualization.
